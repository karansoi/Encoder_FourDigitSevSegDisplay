# Encoder_FourDigitSevSegDisplay
 
This code is to set a value on a four digit seven segment display. The value can be set on each digit by selection. One click selects the leftmost digit. Now turning the shaft sets the value, clicking once again sets it. With the code as placed the value displayed remains zero till the shaft switch is clicked once again. Now the digit is displaying the value. same can be done by clicking twice rotating the rotary and clicking twice again for the next digit.
I have published this with aim to have collaboration to improve the code.
